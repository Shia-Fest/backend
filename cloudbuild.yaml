steps:
# 1. Build the container image
# This step uses Docker to build an image based on the Dockerfile in your repository.
# The image is tagged with the project ID and the unique commit ID for versioning.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-backend:$COMMIT_SHA', '.']

# 2. Push the container image to Google Container Registry
# This step pushes the newly built image to Google's private container registry.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-backend:$COMMIT_SHA']

# 3. Deploy the container image to Cloud Run
# This step uses the gcloud command to deploy the specific image version to your Cloud Run service.
- name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
  entrypoint: gcloud
  args:
    - 'run'
    - 'deploy'
    - 'my-backend-service' # Your Cloud Run service name
    - '--image'
    - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-backend:$COMMIT_SHA'
    - '--region'
    - 'asia-south1'        # The region where your service is deployed
    - '--platform'
    - 'managed'
    - '--allow-unauthenticated'

# This section lists the images that will be pushed to the registry.
images:
- 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/my-backend:$COMMIT_SHA'

# This options section is the fix for the logging permission error.
# It tells Cloud Build to send logs to a specific Cloud Storage bucket you own.
options:
  logging: GCS_ONLY
  logsBucket: 'gs://hude-festival-backend-logs' # <-- IMPORTANT: Replace with your bucket name
